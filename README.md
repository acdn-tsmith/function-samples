# OpenShift Serverless Example Functions

This repository contains example functions supported by OpenShift Serverless.
The samples are generated from the `kn func create` command from OpenShift Serverless
version 1.29 and should be kept up to date as the templates from the `kn func` CLI
are updated.

These samples are used in the OpenShift Developer's Console as templates to help
users get started creating and importing Serverless functions.

Current supported runtimes are Node.js and Quarkus for both HTTP and CloudEvent
functions.
